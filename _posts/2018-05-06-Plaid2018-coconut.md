First we're given an address to connect to. Upon connecting with `nc` we see a bunch of (AT&T ðŸ¤®) x86_64 assembly, and we are told to delete lines to get under a certain threshold without changing the return value. Easy enough! I backtrack from the last write to eax and trace back until I see its final immediate value being written to the stack. Submit those lines, easy flag.

Congrats! Your flag is PCTF{iN3ffic1eent__A5m_K1ll5}

Now on to the next one. This one, as expected, is more of the same. Connecting a few times I see that the assembly changes. @uafio and I try to download all of them and start working on them manually. In 1000 iterations we only found 100 unique assembly listings... That's reasonable. While working through, though, the sense that this isn't it won't leave me. We'll have to automate this.

Now I know in theory how this is done. I've read on [Static single assignment form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form) before. The idea is to re-version every variable every time it's assigned to, and track which version of which variable was used in determining its current value.

So I start writing code!

There are many ways about this. I could use something like [Capstone engine](http://www.capstone-engine.org/) or binja's new SSA form, but truly I don't think I'm going to solve this problem, I just want to understand SSA. Plus my binja license has expired and I don't have the latest updates. I decide to parse the instructions using good 'ol vanilla python. I write some typical fetching/parsing code with pwntools, and think about how to track this.

From all the challenges I've collected, there are only a handful of unique instructions. Mostly `mov`s and arithmetic. All memory accesses are relative to rbp. All register access, other than rbp, is in the extended (32 bit) form. I decide to make it simple: Each register and each offset from rbp is a variable. I can keep track of each version, and for each version, I can track which other variable(s) were used. Here is a nice short sample:

{% highlight bash %}
[+] Opening connection to coconut.chal.pwning.xxx on port 6817: Done
1    .globl    myfunction
2    myfunction:
3    pushq    %rbp
4    movq    %rsp, %rbp
5    movl    $-872808834, -20(%rbp)
6    movl    $1162927757, -16(%rbp)
7    movl    -16(%rbp), %eax
8    movl    -20(%rbp), %edx
9    andl    %edx, %eax
10    movl    %eax, -12(%rbp)
11    movl    -20(%rbp), %eax
12    movl    %eax, -8(%rbp)
13    movl    -16(%rbp), %eax
14    movl    -8(%rbp), %edx
15    andl    %edx, %eax
16    movl    %eax, -4(%rbp)
17    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax
18    popq    %rbp
19    ret
{'%eax': {1: [('[rbp-16]', 1, '7')],
          2: [('%eax', 1, '9'), ('%edx', 1, '9')],
          3: [('[rbp-20]', 1, '11')],
          4: [('[rbp-16]', 1, '13')],
          5: [('%eax', 4, '15'), ('%edx', 2, '15')],
          6: [('[rbp-4]', 1, '17')],
          'last': 6},
 '%edx': {1: [('[rbp-20]', 1, '8')], 2: [('[rbp-8]', 1, '14')], 'last': 2},
 '[rbp-12]': {1: [('%eax', 2, '10')], 'last': 1},
 '[rbp-16]': {1: [('$1162927757', 0, '6')], 'last': 1},
 '[rbp-20]': {1: [('$-872808834', 0, '5')], 'last': 1},
 '[rbp-4]': {1: [('%eax', 5, '16')], 'last': 1},
 '[rbp-8]': {1: [('%eax', 3, '12')], 'last': 1}}
{% endhighlight %}

We see that there are six version of eax. Looking at the sixth version, we see that it used `[rbp-4]` to determine its new value (and not an old version of itself!), it used version 1 of that variable, and that happened on line 17. Looking at line 17 we can clearly see this is the case! Now going to the only version of `[rbp-4]`, we see that it was written from a previous value of eax! We can track this back until we fully exhaust all paths. If we keep track of the lines there occurred on, then we know all of the lines that matter! The astute reader will notice that tracking back in this way is not necessarily optimal: Even looking at the last two versions of eax, we see that it's a useless write to `[rbp-4]` and then a read back! We don't prune this! Luckily, though, that was not an issue, as we managed to prune away enough.

Here's some pseudo code for how to buid this dictionary:

{% highlight python %}
for line in code:
    get src(s), dest, and line number from text, based on opcode
    # Create new version
    newver = dest.lastver + 1
    for each src:
        newver.prereqs.append(src)
    update dest.lastver
{% endhighlight %}

The back-tracking algorithm is a simple [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search). We track all the versions of all variables we need to visit in a queue, starting with the last version of eax (since this is the one that acts as the return value). From there we enqueue all variables that were used to determine this value, and repeat until this queue is empty. When we hit an immediate value, which has no prereq, we've exhausted this particular path.

Here's some more pseudocode:

{% highlight python %}
queue = [last version of eax]
while there are items in the queue:
    current = queue.dequeue()
    for each var that's used in cur:
        queue.enqueue(var)
    mark current as important
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we have a list of important lines, we simply tell it to delete everything else!

At this point I was miraculously solving a few rounds. About 15! But I hit a snag. Turns out every five rounds they add a few instructions, and while the debugging wasn't fun, it mostly just involved finding the problematic instruction and making sure we properly handle it.

With eight hours to go in the CTF my brain was dying and I had to go to sleep with only a few rounds done, and no idea how many total we needed. I woke up again after seven hours, and with a clearer head (and a revealing question from @vakzz) I was able to spot my bug! For certain instructions, e.g. `xorl`, the destination is _also_ a source. I needed to make sure that version x+1 of some variable marked version x as a prereq! Advice: If you're tired and batting your head against a problem, take a nap.

With this fixed, it was just a matter of cleaning it up to make it reliable, and making sure to get the flag when it finally spits it out.

Don't judge my code too much! I hope it's easy to understand.
