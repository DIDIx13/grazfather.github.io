[Practical Malware Analysis](https://www.nostarch.com/malware) has got to be the _best_ technical book I've ever read. I'm currently working though _every_ lab in the book, currently available on my [github](https://github.com/Grazfather/PracticalMalwareLabs). I will eventually move these here so they're more readable.
